# 🛠️ Scripts

This folder contains custom scripts I've written or modified during my cybersecurity journey.

Tools include:
- Enumeration helpers
- Payload generators
- Automation snippets
- Post-exploitation tools
- Automation helpers

Each script is designed for clarity, reusability, and practical use in labs or real-world ops.
