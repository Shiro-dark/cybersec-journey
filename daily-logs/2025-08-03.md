## 🔍 HTTP Verb Tampering – Manual Web Exploitation Tactics

### 🧰 What You Learned

- **HTTP Verb Tampering**  
  → Used non-standard methods (`HEAD`, `OPTIONS`, etc.) to bypass protections  
  → Learned how logic flaws can be triggered without proper method checks

- **OPTIONS Request**  
  → Discovered how `OPTIONS` shows allowed HTTP methods via `Allow:` header  
  → Valuable for mapping attack surface before fuzzing or tampering

- **HEAD Request Abuse**  
  → Understood that `HEAD` skips the body but still runs backend logic  
  → Exploitable if only GET/POST are protected (e.g. deletes, updates still allowed via HEAD)

- **Misconfigured Basic Auth**  
  → Found that some servers only guard `GET` and `POST`  
  → `HEAD` and others may sneak past if not explicitly denied

### ⚠️ Why It Matters

- **Scanners Miss It**  
  → Most automated tools only test `GET` and `POST`  
  → Manual method switching reveals hidden vulnerabilities

- **Impact Potential**  
  → Trigger sensitive actions (like file deletes or updates) without credentials  
  → Bypass security layers via unguarded HTTP verbs

## ✅ Summary

- Practiced advanced HTTP method tampering  
- Identified hidden backend logic execution via `HEAD`  
- Learned to leverage `OPTIONS` for reconnaissance  
- Validated why manual testing beats scanners in edge cases
