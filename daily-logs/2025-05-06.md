## 🎯 Focus: NTLMv2 Cracking, Responder, and File Upload Exploitation

---

## 🔓 NTLMv2 + Responder Workflow

- ✅ Gained in-depth understanding of the **NTLMv2 challenge-response authentication flow**
- ✅ Studied the structure and purpose of **NetNTLMv2 hashes**
- ✅ Used **Responder** to perform LLMNR/NBT-NS spoofing and capture hashes
- ✅ Successfully **cracked NetNTLMv2 hashes** using `John the Ripper` with wordlists
- ✅ Leveraged cracked credentials via **Evil-WinRM** to gain authenticated PowerShell access
- ✅ Identified the inherent risks of **Windows Remote Management (WinRM)** when exposed
- ✅ Analyzed how NTLM is still exploited in modern LAN-based attacks

---

## 🗂️ File Upload Exploitation – Technical Breakdown

- ✅ Studied common **upload filter mechanisms**:
  - Blacklist vs whitelist-based validation
  - Regular expression logic errors and bypass techniques
- ✅ Performed **extension fuzzing** using Burp Suite Intruder
- ✅ Utilized payloads from **SecLists** and **PayloadsAllTheThings**
- ✅ Tested upload bypass techniques including:
  - `shell.jpg.php`
  - `shell.php.jpg`
  - `shell.phar`
  - `shell.php%00.jpg`
  - Double extensions and null byte injection

---

## 🛠️ Hands-On Practice

- 🧪 Analyzed raw HTTP requests for upload forms
- 🔍 Inspected server responses using Burp Suite
- 🔁 Repeated and fuzzed file uploads to identify misconfigured filters
- ⚙️ Executed uploaded web shells to simulate post-upload command injection
- 🧠 Matched content-based responses using Content-Length as a side-channel indicator

---

## 🧠 Reflections & Mental Framework

- Identified hacking as a blend of **logical structure and creative exploitation**
- Recognized that true penetration testing requires **chaining minor misconfigurations**
- Reinforced the importance of mastering offensive tools over relying on automated frameworks
- Internalized the mindset shift: *skill is the source of power — not permission*

---

## ✅ Summary

- Solidified technical foundation in **LAN-based hash harvesting and cracking**
- Gained practical exploitation experience in **file upload vulnerabilities**
- Strengthened understanding of **real-world exploitation paths** and how small missteps lead to full compromise
- Continued aligning skillset toward **OSCP methodology** and **real-world red teaming**
