### 🛠️ What I Did

- **Threat Hunter / Deception Concepts:**
  - DMZ = buffer network between Internet and internal network
  - DMZ + honeypot = layered defense concept
  - CTF-in-CTF (maze tactic) = deception to waste attacker time
  - Deception engineering = YOUR ideal mindset confirmed

- **LOLBin (Living Off The Land Binaries):**
  - Legit Windows tools abused for attacks
  - Examples: `rundll32.exe`, `certutil.exe`, `powershell.exe`
  - Detected `rundll32` traces in your own logs

- **IDS / IPS Concepts:**
  - IDS = detects bad traffic
  - IPS = detects + blocks bad traffic
  - Common tools: Snort, Suricata, Zeek

- LOLBins are essential to monitor — they're stealth attack channels  
- IDS/IPS are core to layered defense stack
