## üí• SSRF Exploitation Techniques

### ‚úÖ What You Learned

- **SSRF Fundamentals**
  - Leveraged server to send internal HTTP requests
  - Identified vulnerable parameters via fuzzing

- **Internal Enumeration via SSRF**
  - Performed **internal port scanning** using SSRF and response filtering
  - Discovered hidden endpoints and files through SSRF `.php` fuzzing
  - Accessed **restricted internal admin panels** by targeting 127.0.0.1

- **Advanced SSRF Payloads**
  - Used `file://` scheme for internal file reads (LFI via SSRF)
  - Sent POST requests through SSRF using the `gopher://` protocol
  - Performed **SMTP injection** via SSRF using Gopherus to trigger internal email behavior

## üõ†Ô∏è Tool Usage ‚Äì ffuf

- Practiced using `ffuf` with:
  - Header injection and manual `Content-Type` configuration
  - POST body fuzzing and `FUZZ` placement
  - Filtering responses and matching on content length/status
- Differentiated:
  - **Endpoint fuzzing**
  - **File/path fuzzing**
  - **Port-level SSRF scans**

## ‚úÖ Summary

- Gained full understanding of SSRF exploitation techniques and attack surface
- Practiced internal scanning, LFI chaining, and gopher protocol abuse
- Improved fuzzing accuracy and payload targeting using `ffuf`
