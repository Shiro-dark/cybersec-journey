## 🛠️ Bug Bounty / Web Exploitation Practice

### 🔍 File Upload Bypass Techniques
- Practiced advanced file upload bypass techniques using Burp Suite
- Tested multiple extensions:
  - `.php`, `.php.jpg`, `.phar`, `.pht`, `.php.`
- Learned that:
  - Uploading a PHP file ≠ code execution
  - Apache must parse the extension as PHP for code to run

### 🔐 Observed Behavior Differences
- Explored difference between:
  - ✅ File upload accepted
  - ✅ File stored in the web directory
  - ❌ File not executed as PHP
- Understood server behavior:
  - Apache executes only recognized extensions
  - MIME type and `.htaccess` configurations affect file handling

### 🧪 Payload Behavior
- Realized:
  - `system($_GET['cmd'])` = only works *if* the file executes
  - `system('cat /flag.txt')` = runs on page load *if* allowed
- Execution depends on server config, not just file name

## 🎨 Project Work

### ✅ Website Template – First Version Complete
- Finished building and styling a basic homepage template
- Focused on clean layout, responsive structure, and minimal aesthetic
- Prepping for public portfolio use

---

## 📌 Summary
- Strengthened understanding of **upload bypass vs execution**
- Learned how server config determines **code execution viability**
- First website template complete and ready for future demos
