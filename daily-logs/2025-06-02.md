---

### üõ†Ô∏è What I Did

- **Brute-Forcing Tools:**
  - Used **Hydra** for form logins, SSH, Basic Auth
  - Explored **Medusa** for multi-host brute attempts
  - Practiced:
    - `http-post-form` syntax
    - Customizing request body & failure conditions
    - Spraying creds across services/subdomains

- **Web Recon Concepts:**
  - Understood tool differences:
    - `subfinder`: DNS-based subdomain enumeration
    - `ffuf`: directory & virtual host fuzzing
    - `ajax spider`: in-page link crawling (DOM)
  - Virtual host fuzzing using `Host:` header tricks
  - `/etc/hosts` editing to simulate internal vhosts

- **iPad for Business:**
  - Unlinked iCloud/iPhone ‚Äî now standalone
  - Clean slate setup for pro use (CVs, client demos)
  - Tweaked home screen for clean, business-ready UX
  - Explored suitable IT-vibe wallpapers

### üß† Lessons Learned

- Brute-forcing isn't just power ‚Äî it's about precision and feedback handling
- Web recon needs multiple tools with different layers: DNS, paths, DOM
- `/etc/hosts` is key for local vhost mapping when fuzzing internal targets
- Device repurposing = underestimated productivity move
