## 🔍 Network Traffic Analysis – Wireshark & tcpdump

### ✅ Concepts Gained
- ARP, mDNS, NTP, and ICMPv6 appear naturally on LANs as broadcast traffic
- Identified HTTP request details in Wireshark (GET, user-agent, host headers)
- Hex pane = raw packet data breakdown
- Captured traffic in Pwnbox using:
  - `tcpdump -i tun0 -w capture.pcap`
  - Imported `.pcap` into Wireshark for analysis

## ⚙️ Nmap Scanning Logic

### ✅ Techniques Practiced
- `-sC -Pn`: runs default scripts, disables host discovery
- `-sV`: enables version detection
- `-p-`: scans all 65535 ports
- ACK scans detect **firewalled but unfiltered** ports
- `nmap -o` requires a valid filename, not an invalid flag or label — misuse triggers warning

## 🧠 Privilege Escalation & PEAS Usage

### ✅ Windows Enumeration Workflow
- Used `smbclient -L //IP -N` to list SMB shares without login
- Identified default shares: `ADMIN$`, `C$`, and custom `backups`
- Cloned `PEASS-ng` and discovered:
  - Git clone = source only
  - `.exe` binaries are in GitHub **Releases**, not the repo root
- Discovered:
  - Running `certutil` places files in `C:\Windows\System32` unless otherwise specified
  - Used `dir /s /b winpeas.exe` to locate binary after execution failed

## 🔐 Web + SSH Login Chain Logic

### ✅ Authentication Flow Lessons
- SSH access not always valid even when creds are known
- Determined service linkage through recon:
  - Verified whether creds apply to web, SSH, SMB, or SQL
- Evaluated endpoints like `/enroll.php` and `/contact.php` — identified **non-auth forms** (no password field, no session behavior)

---

## ⚠️ System Fixing – File Handling Awareness

### ✅ Shell Misuse Recovered
- Learned that omitting `-a` with `tee` overwrites files
- Repaired `/etc/hosts` after accidental overwrite to restore DNS resolution

---

## ✅ Summary

- Strengthened skills in Wireshark, tcpdump, and packet interpretation
- Practiced Nmap and SMB enumeration with real-world logic
- Learned structured use of PEAS tools and binary handling on Windows
- Identified web vs SSH access logic in hybrid login challenges
- Gained recovery experience from destructive shell command misuse
