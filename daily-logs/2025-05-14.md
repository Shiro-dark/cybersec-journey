## 🔓 Vulnerability Practice – SSTI (Server-Side Template Injection)

### ✅ What You Learned
- Studied SSTI in **Node.js (Handlebars)**
- Learned that Handlebars is **sandboxed by default**
- Tested payloads like `{{7*7}}` to confirm injection
- Escaped the sandbox using:
  - `.constructor.prototype`
  - `.apply()`
  - `process.mainModule.require('child_process')`
- Executed OS commands (`whoami`, `ls /root`) from inside the template

---

## 🧠 HackTricks Reflection
- Used HackTricks to study and test advanced payloads
- ✅ Rewrote key techniques into personal `.md` files (legal for exam prep)
- Recognized HackTricks as a **training ground**, not a crutch

---

## 💡 Mindset & Methodology

- ✅ Focused on muscle memory through **structured repetition**
- ✅ Recognized that *you don’t need to know everything*, just how to think

---

## 🏁 Boxes Completed – HTB Academy

### ✅ Completed:
- `Three`
- `Ignition`
- `Biker`

### 🔍 What You Practiced
- Enumeration via Nmap, ffuf, header analysis
- SSTI exploitation in Handlebars (`Biker`)
- Basic auth bypass and misconfig exploration (`Three`)
- Command injection and privilege escalation workflows
- Full exploitation loop: **enum → foothold → escalate → flag**

---

## ✅ Summary

- Rooted 3 machines in a day, including advanced SSTI exploitation
- Converted HackTricks insights into personal knowledge base
- Sharpened hacking reflexes across multiple scenarios
- Shifted into long-term mindset: **train slow, move fast, never quit**
