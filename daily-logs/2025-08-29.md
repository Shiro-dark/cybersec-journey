## 💥 HTTP Verb Tampering → Command Injection Chain

### 🔓 Vulnerability Discovery (File Manager App)

- 🔐 Filtered POST requests using `preg_match`
- 🧪 Input: `test;` → triggered "Malicious Request Denied!"
- ⚙️ Method switched to `GET` using Burp Suite → bypassed filter
- ✅ Result: file was created → filter skipped for GET

---

### 🧨 Exploitation Chain

- Payload: `file1; touch file2;`
- Encoded as: `file1%3B+touch+file2%3B`
- Sent via GET → not inspected by POST-only validation
- Outcome: Both `file1` and `file2` created ⇒ Command Injection successful

---

### 🔍 Why This Worked

- Validation only applied to `$_POST['filename']`
- Execution used `$_REQUEST['filename']` ⇒ includes GET, POST, COOKIE
- No enforced HTTP method in backend
- Common developer mistake: mixing input sources

---

### 🧰 Tools Used

- 🧩 **Burp Suite** → Change Request Method to test GET/POST/HEAD/etc.
- 🌐 **Browser** (Firefox) → confirm file creation in UI
- 🐧 **Linux Payloads** → `touch` used for PoC

---

### 🧠 Key Takeaways

- HTTP method = attack surface → test beyond GET/POST
- Filters must be verb-agnostic and source-consistent
- Security scanners often miss logic flaws → manual testing essential
- Always enforce method server-side (405 on others)
- Never trust $_REQUEST in sensitive logic
