🧨 DAILY RECAP — 29/08 — VERB TAMPERING + COMMAND INJECTION

🔓 Logic Flaw Found
→ Filters only blocked POST → switched to GET
→ Filter skipped, backend logic still executed

🔧 Exploit Chain (File Manager)
→ Input: file1; touch file2;
→ Encoded: file1%3B+touch+file2%3B
→ Sent via GET → bypassed filter
→ Result: both files created (command injection success)

🧪 Tools & Process
→ Used Burp → Change Request Method
→ Verified with Firefox UI + file links
→ Filter triggered only on POST → GET went unchecked

🔍 Why It Works
→ $_POST was filtered, $_REQUEST was executed
→ App logic ran regardless of method
→ Scanner misses — manual tampering wins

✅ Red Team Takeaways
→ Always test all verbs
→ Validate in backend, not just UI
→ Mix logic flaw + injection = powerful combo

🧠 Mental Upgrade
→ Attack the assumptions in developer logic
→ Think like the code was rushed — then break it
