## ðŸ”“ File Upload Attack Techniques

### âœ… What You Practiced
- Payload injection via:
  - **SVG files**
  - **Filename tricks**
  - **Image metadata abuse**
- Performed **XXE attacks** using crafted DTDs:
  - `<!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "file:///etc/passwd">`
- Fuzzed:
  - `Content-Type` headers
  - File extensions
  - Upload filter logic using **Burp Suite Intruder**
- Applied payloads from:
  - **SecLists**
  - **PayloadsAllTheThings**

### âœ… Execution Targets
- Simulated **upload-based command execution**
- Validated whether files were stored, parsed, or blocked
- Tested multiple bypass chains to force server-side parsing

## âœ… Summary
- Gained hands-on experience with modern file upload abuse vectors
- Reinforced how server config (MIME, extension parsing) controls execution
