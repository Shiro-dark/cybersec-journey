## 🔐 Mobile Router Hardening

- Hardened a portable/mobile router for secure offensive ops:
  - Disabled remote admin and WPS
  - Set custom static DNS
  - Separated SSIDs for band control (2.4GHz/5GHz)
  - Disabled unused services (UPnP, remote mgmt)
  - Tuned TX power to limit signal bleed

---

## 🌐 VPN & Traffic Routing Practice

- Connected to **Hack The Box VPN**
- Configured **proxychains** and **Burp Suite** to intercept traffic
- Tested split tunneling and local-only routing logic
- Validated WiFi interface isolation for OPSEC reasons

---

## 🎯 SSRF Exploitation Mastery

- Discovered and confirmed **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)** vector
- Practiced internal port scanning via SSRF using `ffuf`
- Used SSRF + `gopher://` to:
  - Send **crafted POST requests**
  - Access internal admin services
  - Trigger hidden functionality via custom payloads

---

## 🛠 Tooling & Command Usage

- Practiced `ffuf`:
  - Header fuzzing
  - POST body injection
  - Filtering by status code/content length
- Used `Gopherus` to generate valid SSRF + Gopher payloads
- Combined URL schemes for SSRF chaining: `http://`, `file://`, `gopher://`

---

## ✅ Summary

- Locked down network hardware for mobile hacking
- Achieved deep SSRF exploitation using custom payload logic
- Reinforced OPSEC principles and live VPN traffic routing
- Demonstrated offensive chaining from recon → SSRF → internal POST attack
