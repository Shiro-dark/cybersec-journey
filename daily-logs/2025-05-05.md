## 🔥 Core Systems + Hacking Concepts Mastered

### ✅ Syscalls & Registers
- Understood how user programs communicate with the kernel using registers and syscall numbers.
  - `eax/rax` → syscall number  
  - `edi/rdi` → file descriptor  
  - `rsi` → pointer to message  
  - `rdx` → length
- Realized you don’t "print text" — you **instruct the kernel to do it**.

### ✅ GDB = Hacker Weapon
- Learned to use GDB not just for debugging, but for:
  - Catching crashes  
  - Analyzing stack flow  
  - Locating buffer offsets  
  - Taking control of EIP/RIP

### ✅ PIE + RIP-Relative Execution
- With PIE enabled:
  - Code loads at random addresses
  - Execution becomes RIP-relative  
- If PIE is off:
  - Fixed addresses = easier exploitation

### ✅ Ring Levels Breakdown
- Ring 0 = Kernel (full control inside OS)  
- Ring 3 = Userland apps  
- Ring 1/2 = Legacy tiers (rare)  
- Bare Metal = No OS, always in Ring 0

### ✅ Context Switching
- CPU doesn't multitask, it **swaps** contexts by saving/loading registers.
- Realized how the illusion of multitasking is built.

### ✅ Bare Metal vs Ring 0
| Bare Metal        | Ring 0                |
|------------------|-----------------------|
| No OS            | Inside OS (Kernel)    |
| Total control     | OS-controlled         |
| Used in BIOS, bootloaders | Used in drivers/modules |

## 🎮 Bare Metal + Gamedev Madness

### ✅ You Can Write Games in ASM
- Direct VGA control, input, logic = total dominance  
- Even DOOM has been ported to bare metal environments

### ✅ DOOM in C + ASM
- Engine by John Carmack  
- Performance-critical parts written in x86 assembly  
- That’s why it runs on *anything* (yes, even on a toothbrush)

## ⚙️ Kernel & Bootloader Roles

### ✅ Bootloader
- First 512 bytes loaded by BIOS to `0x7C00`
- Sets CPU mode, loads kernel, jumps to it

### ✅ Kernel
- Takes over full system control  
- Can run games, OS, or malware  
- You're the god process now

## 🔧 NASM (Netwide Assembler)
- Used for raw x86 Assembly  
- Essential for:
  - Bootloaders  
  - Shellcode  
  - Exploit crafting  
  - Reverse engineering  
- Core skill for OSCP prep & real hacking

---

## ✅ Summary
- Shifted from surface-level to **core system mastery**
- Built real-world understanding of kernel interaction, execution control, and low-level mechanics
- Mindset leveled up: not just learning hacking
