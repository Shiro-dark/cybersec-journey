### 🔥 Focus

EDR, Windows log parsing, Linux+ prep, training platforms, satellite tracking concepts.

### 🛠️ What I Did

- **EDR + AMSI:**
  - EDR = Endpoint Detection and Response → advanced endpoint security
  - AMSI = lets EDR inspect obfuscated scripts
  - Windows Defender + AMSI = basic EDR
  - Possible to build mini-EDR with Sysmon + ELK + Bash/Python

- **Windows Log Parsing:**
  - `.evtx` files → convertible and parsable on Linux
  - Tools: EvtxECmd, Chainsaw, Hayabusa
  - Possible to grep + parse in Bash after conversion

- **Satellite Tracking (Latency Analysis):**
  - Latency alone = rough region estimate
  - Not precise GPS — needs more signals
  - Agencies use triangulation, Doppler, and more

- **Linux+ Path:**
  - Linux+ first → RHCSA later is optimal
  - LPIC-2 requires LPIC-1 first
  - Linux+ topics:
    - Users/groups, systemctl, journald
    - Firewall basics, Bash scripting, SELinux
    - Filesystem hierarchy, disk mgmt
  - Current knowledge = ~50-60% Linux+ ready

- **Training Platforms:**
  - HTB Academy + TryHackMe Linux Fundamentals = covers Linux+ core
  - FreeCodeCamp Bash scripting = great for loops & vars
  - Current Kali + Ubuntu VMs are perfect for practice

### 🧠 Lessons Learned

- Building EDRs is doable — start with Sysmon  
- Linux log parsing is powerful — learn toolchains  
- Linux+ is very reachable — current prep is strong  
- Satellite tracking ≠ exact GPS — think like an intel agent

### ✅ Summary

- Covered EDR stack, log parsing tools, satellite tracking  
- Advanced Linux+ path mapped  
- Training stack ready: HTB, THM, FreeCodeCamp
