## 🔓 HTTP Verb Tampering + Command Injection Chain

### 🧠 What You Learned

#### 🔧 HTTP Method Tampering
- Discovered how filters often only inspect `POST` parameters (e.g. `$_POST['param']`)
- Bypassed input validation by switching method from `POST` → `GET`
- Used **Burp Suite** → "Change Request Method" to replay requests with different HTTP verbs

#### 🧪 Vulnerability Discovery (File Manager App)
- Triggered a backend filter with special characters → received `Malicious Request Denied!`
- Modified request method → **filter bypassed**, file creation succeeded
- Confirmed the app lacked full method coverage in its validation logic

#### 🧨 Exploitation Chain
- Injected payload in filename field: `file1; touch file2;`
- Encoded payload for URL (`file1%3B+touch+file2%3B`)
- Switched to `GET` → filter didn’t trigger
- Result: Both files (`file1`, `file2`) were created → **command injection achieved**

#### 🔍 Why This Works
- Filter logic applied only to certain methods (POST), backend logic ran regardless of method
- Security scanners usually test `POST`/`GET` only → **manual verb tampering goes deeper**

---

### ✅ Takeaways
- HTTP method = attack surface. Never assume only GET/POST matter
- Input validation must cover **all** verbs
- Command injection + method tampering = powerful combo
- Manual Burp testing finds flaws scanners miss

---

### Tools Used
- Burp Suite (Request Method Tampering)
- Firefox for validation
- Linux command injection payloads

---

### 🔐 Mindset Gained
- Look for logic flaws, not just injection points
- Think like a developer who cut corners — then break what they forgot to secure
