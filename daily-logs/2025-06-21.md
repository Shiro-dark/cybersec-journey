### üî• Focus

Full-stack sysadmin + pentesting workflow ‚Äî firewalls, ports, backups, CLI tools.

### üõ†Ô∏è What I Did

- **Firewall & Ports:**
  - Learned how to check open ports
  - Block/whitelist specific ports
  - Cleaned Windows firewall rules
  - Identified legacy ports (SMB, RPC, NetBIOS, Remote Assistance) and disable scenarios
  - Understood "default deny" firewall principle

- **API & Scraping:**
  - Understood core API logic
  - API vs scraping relationship
  - Attacking APIs (IDOR, rate limiting, injection)
  - F12 Network tab to inspect API calls
  - Burp Suite to intercept/modify API calls

- **Race Condition vs Resource Exhaustion:**
  - Race = timing attack
  - Resource = CPU/RAM/socket overload
  - Attack difference clarified

- **Shimming vs Refactoring:**
  - Shimming = compatibility layer
  - Refactoring = code changes
  - How refactoring can hide malicious logic

- **Tar + Rsync:**
  - What `tar` does vs `rsync`
  - `rsync` = incremental backup tool
  - Restore from rsync
  - `tar -cf` vs `tar -czf` (compression or not)

- **SCP:**
  - What is `scp` (secure copy)
  - Why it leaves logs
  - When attackers avoid it

- **Force Filesystem Check:**
  - `touch /forcefsck`
  - What is `fsck` and forced disk checks

- **Windows Log Clearing:**
  - `wevtutil` command
  - How to clear all Windows logs
  - Why big logs slow Event Viewer but not the OS
  - Importance of log rotation

### ‚úÖ Summary

- Solid firewall + opsec foundation  
- API hacking mindset sharpened  
- Mastered key backup + file transfer tools  
- Deepened understanding of system stability & cleanup
