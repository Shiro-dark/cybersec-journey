## 🎯 Bug Bounty Program Structure & Scoping

### ✅ What You Learned
- Bug bounty programs follow strict **policies and rules of engagement**
- Targets must be **explicitly in-scope** — even exploitable bugs may be rejected if out-of-scope
- Not all findings are valid unless there’s proven **impact**
- Example: Host Header Injection is often dismissed if no redirection/poisoning occurs
- Rule: **Always read the bounty policy before testing**

## 🔐 SSH Local Port Forwarding – Practical Use

### ✅ Technique Mastered
- Used `ssh -L 1337:127.0.0.1:5432` to create a local tunnel:
  - Port `1337` on local machine forwards to port `5432` on the remote machine’s loopback
- Used this tunnel to access internal services externally without a shell
- Understood that the tunnel functions **independently** of interactive SSH

## 🧠 PostgreSQL Exploitation via Tunnel

### ✅ Real-World Application
- Detected Postgres listening on `127.0.0.1:5432` (non-exposed)
- Accessed Postgres through SSH port forwarding
- Interacted with the database using local tools (`psql` client)
- Extracted sensitive data/flag directly from the database via SQL

## 📂 FTP Service Assessment

### ✅ Recon & Enumeration
- Identified FTP service on port `21` accessible from public network
- Connected as `anonymous` user — verified **read-only permissions**
- Assessed write access from alternate users (via Christine)
- Evaluated potential escalation paths: file drops, cron jobs, or writable SUID binaries

---

## ✅ Summary

- Learned structured bug bounty methodology (scope, impact, policy)
- Mastered SSH tunneling to expose internal services securely
- Successfully accessed and exploited PostgreSQL via tunnel
- Performed full FTP recon and access validation
