### 🔐 Login Brute Forcing – Full Execution Chain

- ✅ Used `ffuf` to enumerate valid usernames from HTTP POST forms
- ✅ Applied `-fr "Unknown user"` to isolate working usernames
- ✅ Saved structured output using `-o <file> -of json`
- ✅ Parsed ffuf output with `jq` to extract usernames cleanly
- ✅ Switched from `ffuf` (recon phase) to `Hydra`/`Medusa` (attack phase)

---

### ⚔️ Hydra & Medusa Efficiency

- ✅ Determined when to brute single user vs spraying full lists
- ✅ Used `http-get` module for Basic Auth logins (401-style)
- ✅ Deployed `http-post-form` logic for web form credentials
- ✅ Bruteforced using `valid_users.txt` + top password combos

---

### 💻 Terminal Mastery Boost

- ✅ Clarified `less` = scroll tool (not related to binary view)
- ✅ Refined use of `tee`, `grep`, `awk`, `jq` for live pipelines
- ✅ Practiced directory visualization with `tree`
- ✅ Used `echo | sudo tee -a` to safely edit protected files

---

### 🧨 High-Level Concept Dive – Nuclear Command Logic

- ✅ Studied Russia’s Dead Hand (Perimeter) fail-deadly system
- ✅ Understood human verification + time delay protections
- ✅ Balanced trade-offs between availability, trust, and security
- ✅ Designed your own OPSEC stack:
  - Shamir Secret Sharing
  - Geo-distributed decryption layers
  - Biometrics without vault-location correlation
  - Courier separation logic for physical keys

---

### ✅ Summary

- Mastered brute-force flow from username discovery to password spraying
- Boosted shell pipeline logic and terminal agility
- Explored real-world military OPSEC architecture for red team inspiration
