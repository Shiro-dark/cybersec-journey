# 📅 2025-04-08 – Daily Log

## 🧠 What I Learned
- ✅ Finished the **SQLMap Essentials** module on HTB Academy
- Understood how SQLMap automates parameter fuzzing & DB fingerprinting
- Learned options like `--dbs`, `--current-user`, `--dump`, `--os-shell`
- 🧪 Started **Command Injection** module – learned about `ping` and `whoami` based payloads

## 🛠️ Tools Practiced
- `sqlmap` with custom headers & proxies
- Burp Suite (for identifying injectable points)

## ⚔️ Problems Faced
- Missed a flag at first by not setting `--level=3` — fixed it by reading doc
- Overlooked time-based blind injection detection early on

## 🧩 Notes
- SQLMap is powerful but noisy — best used with precision
- Will revisit `--tamper` scripts once I do WAF modules
- Starting tomorrow, I’ll begin **adding screenshots** to logs
- Will create `/screenshots/` folder and commit terminal/Burp outputs
- Goal: improve visual proof, clarity, and progress tracking
- 
## 🎯 Next Goals
- Finish the second half of Command Injection module
- Test `os-shell` options and learn more about encoding/bypasses
- Add my first screenshots to the 2025-04-09 log
