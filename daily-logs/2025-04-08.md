## 🧠 What I Learned
- ✅ Finished the **SQLMap Essentials** module on HTB Academy
- Understood how SQLMap automates parameter fuzzing & DB fingerprinting
- Learned options like `--dbs`, `--current-user`, `--dump`, `--os-shell`
- 🧪 Started **Command Injection** module – learned about `ping` and `whoami` based payloads

## 🛠️ Tools Practiced
- `sqlmap` with custom headers & proxies
- Burp Suite (for identifying injectable points)

## ⚔️ Problems Faced
- Missed a flag at first by not setting `--level=3` — fixed it by reading doc
- Overlooked time-based blind injection detection early on

## 🧩 Notes
- SQLMap is powerful but noisy — best used with precision
- Will revisit `--tamper` scripts once I do WAF modules
