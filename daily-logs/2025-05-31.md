## 🔍 Firefox UUIDs & Ghost Extension Cleanup

- Discovered how Firefox uses `moz-extension://UUID/` for extensions
- Investigated **orphaned/ghost extensions** with missing `prefs.js` mappings
- Built a **Bash script** to:
  - Identify stale UUIDs in Firefox profiles
  - Detect hidden or leftover extension data
  - Purge manually or verify with known extensions
- Observed that some tools (e.g. Wappalyzer) can leave traces or behave inconsistently after updates

---

## 🕵️‍♂️ SSRF Port Scanning & Fuzzing

- Practiced **SSRF fuzzing** using:
  - `ffuf` for automated payload delivery
  - `-fr` flag to **filter regex patterns** in noisy responses
- Detected **differential responses** across ports (e.g., `“date is unavailable”` vs no reply)
- Identified open/internal ports based on SSRF behavior

---

## 📡 Netcat Listener & SSRF Response Analysis

- Used `nc -lvnp` to catch incoming SSRF requests
- Validated SSRF connections via raw HTTP GET requests
- Realized that **netcat doesn’t reply**, useful only for observing inbound pings/logs

---

## 🔒 Blind SSRF Limitations & Exploitation Logic

- Understood:
  - Blind SSRF = no response; only visible via out-of-band callbacks or logs
  - SSRF alone doesn’t lead to shell access unless **chained with RCE**
  - Reverse shells via SSRF require remote file execution on target server

---

## 🛠 Tools & Commands Practiced

- `ffuf`, `nc`, `Burp Intruder`, `sqlite3`
- Wrote bash scripts to automate:
  - UUID tracing
  - Extension cleanup
  - Internal port scanning via SSRF

---

## ✅ Summary

- Cleaned Firefox profile using UUID tracking logic
- Scanned and mapped internal services via SSRF
- Strengthened your understanding of **listener behavior**, **response timing**, and **exploitation prerequisites**
