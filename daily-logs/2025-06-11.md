### 🔥 Focus

Full terminal workflow mastery, from elite `i3wm` navigation to `tmux` copy mode, local AI toolchains, and turbo recon setup for HTB VPN operations.

### 🛠️ What I Did

#### 🔧 i3wm + tmux Mastery
- Moved, resized, and managed terminals across workspaces and scratchpad
- Opened tools like `firefox &` without blocking terminal sessions
- Used `tmux` panes and sessions for parallel workflow

#### 🧠 Local AI Integration
- Installed `ollama` and ran offline models (Mistral, TinyLlama)
- Built terminal aliasing for fast local AI queries
- Enabled private LLM interaction for offline hacking flow

#### 🌐 HTB VPN Operations
- Connected using `.ovpn`, verified `tun0`, tracked drop/recovery
- Understood internal VPN IP logic (`10.10.x.x`)
- Scanned, pinged, and debugged HTB boxes end-to-end

#### 🔍 Recon Upgrades
- Nmap flags mastered:
  - `-p-`, `--top-ports`, `--min-rate`
  - `-sC -sV -Pn` in full enumeration runs
- Discovered **RustScan** for faster scans (port discovery)

#### 📋 Tmux Copy Flow
- Enabled vi-mode in `.tmux.conf`
- Used:
  - `Ctrl + B + [` → visual `v` → `y` to yank
  - `Ctrl + B + ]` to paste
- Verified tmux config changes and resolved issues
