### üõ†Ô∏è What I Did

- **Login Brute Forcing**
  - Used `ffuf` with filtered response matching (`-fr`) to detect valid login attempts
  - Crafted custom password payloads and filtered results using status, size, and redirects

- **Wordlist Optimization**
  - Filtered a wordlist to include only:
    - Exactly 12-character entries
    - 1 uppercase, 1 lowercase, 1 digit
    - No special characters

- **OTP Bypass & 2FA Logic**
  - Identified weak OTP logic:
    - Brute-forced numeric codes
    - Dictionary attack against short OTPs
    - Manual logic flaw exploitation to bypass 2FA

- **Logic Flaw Exploitation**
  - Skipped 2FA with:
    - Redirect manipulation (`/2fa.php ‚Üí /profile.php`)
    - Blocking redirection to extract data

- **Session Fixation**
  - Reused PHP session tokens (`PHPSESSID`) to hijack accounts
  - Understood how sessions are mapped, not encrypted

### üß† Mindset Upgrade

- Replaced assumptions with tests ‚Äî no ‚Äúthat wouldn‚Äôt work‚Äù until it‚Äôs proven
- Saw how real-world attackers think and move
- Broke through the HTB Broken Authentication module

### ‚úÖ Summary

- Completed: HTB Broken Authentication Module  
- Learned: Brute-forcing, 2FA bypass, logic flaws, session hijacking  
- Practiced: Filter crafting, payload tuning, social engineering theory  
- Result: Hardened your red team brain and doubled down on attacker logic
