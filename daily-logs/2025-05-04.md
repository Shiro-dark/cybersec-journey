# 🧠 Daily Log – May 4, 2025

## 🎯 HTB Startup Labs Rampage

## ✅ What I Did
- Pwned **8 machines** in a single day from the **HTB Startup Labs**.
- Built experience with:
  - SMB enumeration
  - FTP & SSH access
  - HTTP fuzzing
  - SQL injection & brute-force attacks
  - Metasploit usage for legacy exploits
  - Manual and scripted recon techniques

## 🛠️ Skills Practiced
- Recognized common service banners and fingerprinted OS versions
- Used `gobuster`, `nmap -sC -sV -p`, `hydra`, `smbclient`, and `sqlmap`
- Interacted with multiple service types including:
  - FTP, SMB, HTTP, SSH, MySQL, MariaDB
- Alternated between automated tools and manual exploitation for control and depth

## ⚔️ Mental Gains
- Increased speed, confidence, and enumeration efficiency
- Strengthened internal playbook for beginner-to-intermediate box flow
- Repeated exploitation patterns across machines = muscle memory building

## 🧠 Reflections
- First time fully *flowing through multiple pwns in one sitting*  
- Started recognizing exploit patterns instantly  
- No burnout — just tunnel vision. Pure grind.

## ✅ Summary
- 8 HTB machines rooted  
- Tools = sharper  
- Mindset = locked  
- One step closer to OSCP readiness
